How to run Scripts?
```
1. Install Python: If you haven't already, download and install Python from the official Python website (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Make sure to add Python to your system's PATH during installation so that you can run Python scripts from the command prompt.
2. Download the raw file of desired script and run it.
